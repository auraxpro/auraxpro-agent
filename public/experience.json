        "experience": "Developed a comprehensive 2D-to-3D room planning platform that enables interior designers and real estate professionals to create interactive floor plans. The project involved building a sophisticated 2D sketch editor using Fabric.js, integrating React Three Fiber for real-time 3D rendering, and implementing AI-powered furniture detection. Successfully optimized 3D scene performance by 30% through GLB compression techniques and dynamic texture loading. Implemented state management with Zustand for seamless synchronization between 2D and 3D views. The platform handles complex lighting scenarios, texture mapping, and real-time user interactions while maintaining smooth performance across different devices.",
        "lessons_learned": "Optimized GLB compression and dynamic texture loading improved performance by 30%. Key learnings include: (1) Baking textures in Blender significantly reduces runtime texture processing, (2) Tone mapping and physically correct lighting create more realistic renders, (3) State synchronization between 2D and 3D views requires careful architecture, (4) GLB optimization is crucial for web-based 3D applications.",
